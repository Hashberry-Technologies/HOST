# ABOUT $HOST

$HOST which stands for Hashberry Over-Simplified Token is a community-based and community-driven token, that is partially coded in Kannada, guaranteeing complete transparency through every milestone of the project. Hashberry Technologies is building a platform for everyone to implement a cryptocurrency that forms part of the expanding Hashberry ecosystem. The project is founded by [Sherwin Vishesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherwinvishesh) with the intention to provide a fast, secure and easy way for people to receive crypto in a simplified manner. This being said, Hashberry Technologies aims to deliver other projects such as its own NFT Marketplace where all the generated proceedings will be used to buy back the token and be burned.

#### The basic principles of the smart contract that CxCoin is run are:

* Locked : 30% of the tokens are Locked-Up until 2030.
* Token Burnt: 10% of the tokens are in Burner Wallet
* LP Tokens: The Liquidity pool tokens are burnt, avoiding the chances of Rug pool.
* Anti-Whale Mechanism
